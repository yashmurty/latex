The objective of this airplane design is to build an aircraft capable of carrying
a payload much greater than its structural weight. The mission profile includes
take-off, a 360 degree turn and landing on the same airplance strip.

Second paragraph can be on the work done so far in designing and fabrication of the aircraft.
Overall, abstract should be less than or equal to 2 pages.
